## CSS Classes for form elements

add the class "main-content" to your main element

I created a very simple grid system for the fomrs

First wrap every thing you wants in a horozontial row in a div with classes "grid group"

EG.

	<!-- <div class="grid group"> ONE FULL ROW GOES IN HERE</div> -->

each row has 4 columns. you can use them to do half and half, full, 1/4 and 3/4 or 3/4 and 1/4

to create the comulms add a column class to a div that wraps you elements in the row
also add a form-section class to each column you make

EG.

	<!-- <div class="col-2 form-section"> YOUR FORM ELEMENTS GO HERE </div> -->

Make sure you fill your rows so if you are only using a col-2 add an extra col-2 to the row to fill the space.

Form elements also have css classes

on a TEXT INPUT add the css class "form-input"

EG.

	<!-- <input type="text" name="yourName" id="yourID" class="form-input" value="Your Value"> -->

on a TEXT AREA add the css classes "form-input form-textarea"

EG.

	<!-- <textarea id="elementID" class="form-input form-textarea"></textarea>

for a drop down list add the classes "form-input form-ddl"

EG.

	<!-- <SELECT name="elementName" id="elementID" class="form-input form-ddl"> </select>-->

For buttons add a class of "btn" and then depending on the function of the button add "btn-submit or btn-cancel"

EG.

	<!-- <button type="submit" class="btn btn-submit">Submit</button> -->
